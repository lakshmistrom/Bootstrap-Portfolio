# Lakshmi Strom's Professional portfolio
This particular project will become my portfolio by the end of this BootCamp Class.

I decided to restructure the site to be only one page. 

1. As a user you will be greeted by my tagline of Front End Developer with a passion for responsive design. Links to my github, linkedIn and a way to email me.
2. Either by scrolling or clicking on the portfolio link you will be able to look at my by projects over the years. They are currently in iframes for you to be able to interact with the applications from my page directly.
